Human:  I will provide you a Question, Context, and Possible Answer to the Question. Based only on the information in the Context, and no other background knowledge that you possess, you will answer the Question by providing a probability from 0 to 1. Use the following rules of thumb:
    1. The Context will provide information that will help you decide on the answer to the Question.
    2. If the Context suggests that the answer is something entirely different from the possible answer in the Question, you should provide a probability closer to 0.

    ### Question:
    {question}

    ### Context:
    {generated_paragraph}

    ### Possible Answer:
    {ground_truth_top_answer}

    ### Your Task:
    Based on the Context, what is the probability that "{ground_truth_top_answer}" is the correct answer to the Question?

    1. Answer solely based on the Context, ignoring entirely what you know about the world and the commonsense knowledge you have. This means that if the Context does not explicitly mention "{ground_truth_top_answer}", you should answer 0, because a person with no background knowledge would not be able to infer that "{ground_truth_top_answer}" is a correct answer. In such a case, answer 0 even if the information in the Context closely aligns with "{ground_truth_top_answer}".
    2. Of course, if the Context explicitly mentions "{ground_truth_top_answer}" but with an alternate spelling or stylization, you should consider that a reference to the correct answer (e.g., "The United States of America", "USA", and "United States" refer to the same entity; same with "Timoth√©e Chalamet" and "Timothee Chalamet").
    3. The Context may include statements of uncertainty. These statements may decrease the probability that "{ground_truth_top_answer}" is the correct answer. For example, the phrase "there is a 40% probability that {ground_truth_top_answer} is the answer" would indicate that the Answer Probability = 0.4. However, there may be statements of uncertainty or confidence which do not have anything to do with "{ground_truth_top_answer}", or there may be no such statements at all.
