Human: I am going to provide you with a list of questions, ground-truth answers to those questions, and provided answers.

    By considering the question, you will decide if the provided answer is a synonym of the ground-truth answer, i.e., if the provided answer is correct. If it is, you will answer "Yes". If it is not, you will answer "No".

    Here are some rules of thumb:
    1. If the provided answer is a clear synonym of the ground-truth answer, you should answer "Yes".
    2. If the provided answer is more specific than the ground-truth answer, implying that the ground-truth answer is a correct answer to the question, you should answer "Yes". For example, if the question is "What is the largest animal in the world?" and the ground-truth answer is "whale", then the provided answer "Blue whale" implies that the ground-truth answer is correct, and you should answer "Yes".
    3. If the provided answer is less specific than the ground-truth answer, then you should answer "No".

    First, I will show you a single example.

    ## Example 1
    {
        "Question": "Papules and pustules are types of what on the human skin?",
        "Ground-Truth Answer": "Spots",
        "Provided Answer": "skin conditions"
    }

    ## Answer
    {
        "Answer 1": "No"
    }

    ## Explanation
    {
        "Explanation 1": "The provided answer of 'skin conditions' is much less specific than the ground-truth answer of 'Spots'."
    }
