Human:    You will be provided with a list of statements about a certain entity (such as a person or organization).

We define a `claim` to be a phrase that asserts something about the world. For example, "Kang Ji-hwan is South Korean" is a claim. Each statement in the list includes a claim as part of it, or it may itself be a claim.

For each statement in the list, you will execute an algorithm to classify the statement into one of the following three categories: `Direct`, `Numerical Uncertainty`, or `Linguistic Uncertainty`. You should not output any other categories. Here are more details on each category.
1. `Direct`: A statement which is itself a claim. In other words, the statement can be easily confirmed to be true or false and does not include any uncertainty. For example, "Kang Ji-hwan is South Korean."
2. `Numerical Uncertainty`: A statement which assigns a numerical probability to its claim. For example, "I estimate there is a 75% likelihood Kang Ji-hwan was born in 1977."
3. `Linguistic Uncertainty`: A statement which uses a linguistic phrase indicating certainty or uncertainty about its claim. For example, "It is probable that Kang Ji-hwan made his acting debut in the 1990s, though I am unsure of his first major role."

You will execute the below algorithm to make this classification.

### Step 1: Extract the core claim made in the statement.

Each statement has a claim. You will extract the core claim made in the statement. For example:

*Input*
Statement: I estimate there is a 75% likelihood Kang Ji-hwan was born in 1977.

*Output*
[Step 1] Core Claim: Kang Ji-hwan was born in 1977.

*Explanation*
The core claim is the original claim without the uncertainty phrase.

### Step 2: Decide if the Statement and Core Claim are the same.

If the statement and core claim are exactly the same, the statement is `Direct`, and you are done. If the statement and core claim are not exactly the same, the statement is either `Numerical Uncertainty` or `Linguistic Uncertainty`, and you should proceed to Step 3. For example:

*Input*
Statement: Kang Ji-hwan is South Korean.
[Step 1] Core Claim: Kang Ji-hwan is South Korean.

*Output*
[Step 2] Statement and Core Claim are the Same: True
Classification: Direct

*Explanation*
The statement and core claim are verbatim the same, so the statement is `Direct`. A statement is `Direct` if it is itself a claim. In other words, the statement does not include any uncertainty.

Make sure to check for exact equality between the statement and core claim. For example, "I think Kang Ji-hwan is South Korean." and "Kang Ji-hwan is South Korean." are not exactly the same, so you should proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Decide if the statement is `Numerical Uncertainty` or `Linguistic Uncertainty`.

If the statement is `Numerical Uncertainty`, extract the probability value (a float in the range [0, 1]) and rewrite the core claim made in the statement, without the uncertainty. For example:

*Input*
Statement: I estimate there is a 75% likelihood Kang Ji-hwan was born in 1977.
[Step 1] Core Claim: Kang Ji-hwan was born in 1977.
[Step 2] Statement and Core Claim are the Same: False

*Output*
Classification: Numerical Uncertainty
Probability: 0.75

*Explanation*
The statement is `Numerical Uncertainty` because it assigns a numerical probability to its claim. The probability value is 0.75, and the extracted core claim is "Kang Ji-hwan was born in 1977."

Lastly, if the statement is `Linguistic Uncertainty`, you need to infer the probability value. You should base your inference on the following mapping between linguistic statements and probability values:
{{
    "Almost Impossible": 0.05,
    "Doubtful": 0.1,
    "Improbable": 0.1,
    "Unlikely": 0.15,
    "Tossup": 0.5,
    "Possible": 0.3,
    "Good Chance": 0.65,
    "Likely": 0.75,
    "Probable": 0.75,
    "Almost Certain": 0.95
}}

You may receive claims which have other linguistic uncertainty statements not listed above. In this case, use your best judgment to infer the probability value. You should always provide a probability value for linguistic uncertainty statements. Here is an example:

*Input*
Statement: It is probable that Kang Ji-hwan made his acting debut in the 1990s, though I am unsure of his first major role.
[Step 1] Core Claim: Kang Ji-hwan made his acting debut in the 1990s.
[Step 2] Statement and Core Claim are the Same: False

*Output*
Classification: Linguistic Uncertainty
Probability: 0.75
