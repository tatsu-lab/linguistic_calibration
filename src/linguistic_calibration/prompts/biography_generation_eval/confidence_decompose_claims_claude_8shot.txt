Human:

You will be given a short biography about an entity (such as a person or organization). Your task is to decompose this biography into atomic claims. The biography will indicate confidence or uncertainty in some of its claims. You should copy this confidence or uncertainty into your atomic claims using the below guidelines.

The format of your answer will be a nested list as demonstrated in the examples.

## What is an atomic claim?
An atomic claim is a single statement about an entity. It is a statement that cannot be broken down into smaller statements. We will provide two short examples of this below.

### Example 1
The statement "I believe Kang Ji-hwan is a South Korean actor and singer." is not an atomic claim. It can be broken down into the following atomic claims:
1. I believe Kang Ji-hwan is South Korean.
2. I believe Kang Ji-hwan is an actor.
3. I believe Kang Ji-hwan is a singer.

### Example 2
The statement "I believe William Waldegrave is a British politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP)" is not an atomic claim. It can be broken down into the following atomic claims:
1. I believe William Waldegrave is British.
2. I believe William Waldegrave is a politician.
3. I believe William Waldegrave served as a Member of Parliament (MP).

## How do I copy the confidence or uncertainty in the biography into my atomic claims?
Many sentences in the biography will include modifier phrases which indicate confidence or uncertainty. When writing down an atomic claim from a given sentence, you should use your judgment to copy modifier phrases if they modify the atomic claim.

### Example 1
The sentence "I estimate there is a 75% likelihood Kang Ji-hwan was born in 1977, though I am uncertain of the exact year." includes the uncertainty modifier phrases "I estimate there is a 75% likelihood" as well as "though I am uncertain of the exact year." These phrases both modify the atomic claim "Kang Ji-hwan was born in 1977." Therefore, you should copy these phrases into your atomic claim. In fact, this sentence is already an atomic claim, so you should copy the entire sentence into your answer.

### Example 2
The sentence "I am uncertain about the details, but I believe she has written books and articles on topics like feminism and mental health." should be broken into the following atomic claims with uncertainty modifiers:
1. I am uncertain about the details, but I believe she has written books.
2. I am uncertain about the details, but I believe she has written articles.
3. I am uncertain about the details, but I believe she has written books and articles on feminism.
4. I am uncertain about the details, but I believe she has written books and articles on mental health.

## Classifying Claims

You will classify each claim into one of three categories: `Full Uncertainty`, `Subjective`, and `Objective`.

### Example 1: Full Uncertainty
The sentence "I am uncertain about specifics like Kang Ji-hwan's height." is an example of `Full Uncertainty`. This sentence does not make a concrete claim about Kang Ji-hwan's height, so it is `Full Uncertainty`.

### Example 2: Subjective
The sentence "I believe Kang Ji-hwan is considered a talented actor in the Korean entertainment industry." is an example of `Subjective`. This sentence makes a concrete claim about Kang Ji-hwan's acting ability, but it is difficult to confirm as true or false. Therefore, it is `Subjective`.

### Example 3: Objective
The sentence "Kang Ji-hwan was born in 1977." is an example of `Objective`. This sentence makes a concrete claim about Kang Ji-hwan's birth year, and it is easy to confirm as true or false. Therefore, it is `Objective`.

## How should I handle mutually exclusive claims?
Certain sentences in the biography will include multiple mutually exclusive atomic claims. Consider the following sentence:

"I estimate there is a 75% likelihood she was born in Pakistan and a 25% chance she was born in the United States."

This sentence includes two mutually exclusive atomic claims, which are both `Objective`:
1. I estimate there is a 75% likelihood she was born in Pakistan.
2. I estimate there is a 25% likelihood she was born in the United States.

In this case, you should write these claims as a nested list of tuples:
[
    ("""I estimate there is a 75% likelihood she was born in Pakistan.""", "Objective"),
    ("""I estimate there is a 25% likelihood she was born in the United States.""", "Objective)
]

## Example 8

### Entity 8
Keita Kadokura

### Biography 8
I believe Keita Kadokura is a Japanese professional golfer who has achieved success in both amateur and professional golf. I estimate there is a 75% likelihood he was born in 1991, a 15% chance he was born in 1992, and a 10% chance he was born in 1993. I am uncertain if he was raised in Japan or the United States. I believe he likely began playing golf at a young age, possibly around 5 or 6 years old.

I am uncertain whether he attended university or not. If he did attend university, I estimate a 50% chance he studied at Waseda University, a 30% chance he studied at the University of Arizona, and a 20% chance he studied at another university.

I am confident that Kadokura has won multiple amateur and professional golf tournaments over the course of his career. However, I am uncertain about the specifics of his accomplishments. I estimate there is a 60% likelihood he has won the Japan Amateur Championship, a 30% chance he has won the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship, and a 10% chance he has won other tournaments.

Based on my understanding, Kadokura has represented Japan in international golf competitions. I believe he has a strong reputation as a talented golfer, though I do not know all the details of his career. I am confident he has achieved success both as an amateur and professional golfer, though I am uncertain about the specifics of his accomplishments.
