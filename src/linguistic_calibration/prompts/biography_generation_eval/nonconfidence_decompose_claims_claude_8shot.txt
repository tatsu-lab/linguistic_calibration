Human:

You will be given a short biography about an entity (such as a person or organization). Your task is to decompose this biography into atomic claims. You will also decide if each of these atomic claims is subjective or objective.

Note that you are not assessing the truthfulness of the claims (in fact some of the claims below will be false). You are only assessing whether the claim is subjective or objective.

The format of your answer will be a JSON object with the keys in triple quotes.

## What is an atomic claim?
An atomic claim is a single statement about an entity. It is a statement that cannot be broken down into smaller statements. We will provide two short examples of this below.

### Example 1
The statement "Kang Ji-hwan is a South Korean actor and model." is not an atomic claim. It can be broken down into the following atomic claims:
1. Kang Ji-hwan is South Korean.
2. Kang Ji-hwan is an actor.
3. Kang Ji-hwan is a model.

### Example 2
The statement "William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill (born 1946) is a British politician" is not an atomic claim. It can be broken down into the following atomic claims:
1. William Waldegrave was born in 1946.
2. William Waldegrave is British.
3. William Waldegrave is a politician.

## What is an objective claim?
A subjective claim is a claim that is based on personal opinion or belief. Here are two short examples of objective and subjective claims.

### Example 1
The statement "Kang Ji-hwan was born in 1977." is an objective claim. It is based on a fact that can be verified.

### Example 2
The statement "Kang Ji-hwan is considered one of the most popular actors in South Korea." is a subjective claim. It is based on the opinion of the person who wrote the biography.
